[Refactor: Merge authz_resource_file into authz_resource core]
This will mean that authz_resource will ship with a default provider as standard, the file provider.

[Bug: HTTPD Segfaults when file provider config options are not separated by colon]
httpd segfaults when the file config options are not separated by a colon ":'. Fix this.

[Refactor: File provider config options are in non-standard format]
Modify the file conig options to better match the standard apache config file conventions. 
Remove use of colon to separate options. Suggestions include:

Owner ben GET PUT POST
Group admin GET PUT
World GET 

Where Owner and Group use the first argument to specify the username and group.

[Feature: Add directives to allow setting permissions on a Location, File or Directory without the file or dbd providers]
The server admin should be able to add permissions to Locations, Files and directories without having to resort to 
setting up the file provider or configuring a database server.

Example:
<Location /admin>
  AuthType Resource
  AuthzResourcePerms owner ben GET PUT POST DELETE
  AuthzResourcePerms group admin GET POST
  AuthzResourcePerms world GET
  Require resource
</Location>
